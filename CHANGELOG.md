## 0.2.2 - 2018-04-28
### Fixed

of the list show in the other list too.

## 0.2.1 - 2018-04-27
### Fixed
- Correctly detecting if it will go to the buyback list or not by fixing the
`showBuybackList` value which was reversed.

buy price when inputting 120 as margin!)

## 0.2.0 - 2018-04-27
### Added
- File menu and Exit menu item
- Evepraisal parameters (market and price percent), a sell-buy margin
percent parameter and select between showing the item list to sell via sell
orders (default) and items to use buyback or instasell.

### Fixed
- Main window title as it was using a previous title I though for this project
- Increase width for the top labels as they were trimmed in Java default style
